# Underground Economy 
==Definition==: The underground economy refers to unreported illegal activity, bartering, or informal exchange of cash for goods and services that are not reported in official tabulations of GDP. Transactions in the underground economy, such as the illegal sale of goods or services or paying someone cash "under the table" for work, are not counted toward GDP. Informal bartering between individuals, like helping a friend with economics for help with biology, is also not counted, despite being productive. 
# Business Cycle (4 Parts)
==Definition==: The business cycle is the periodic rise and fall in economic activity. It can be measured by changes in real GDP. The cycle illustrates how economic activity, measured by Real GDP, generally moves around its long-term growth trend. It has four main phases:

1. ***Expansion***: A period where real GDP is growing. During expansions, aggregate output rises, and unemployment falls. Historically, expansions have averaged 57 months. 
2. ***Peak***: The top of the cycle where an expansion has run its course and is about to turn down. At this point, inflation is likely the greatest threat to the macroeconomy.
3. ***Contraction/Recession***: A period where real GDP is falling. A recession is generally described as two consecutive quarters of falling real GDP. If a contraction is prolonged or deep enough, it is called a depression. During recessions, unemployment is high. Recessions have historically averaged 10 months. 
4. ***Trough***: The bottom of the cycle where a contraction has stopped and is about to turn up.
*Changes in the business cycle can be caused by changes in investment and spending, innovations and inventions, monetary policy by the federal reserve, and external shocks like supply shocks, wars, or natural disasters. Automatic stabilizers, such as progressive taxes and transfer programs, help to lessen, but not eliminate, these swings in the business cycle.*
# GDP Price Deflator
==Definition==: A price index that measures the average price level of the goods and services that make up GDP. It utilizes the prices of all goods and services that comprise GDP to create a price index. Nominal GDP is "deflated" using this price index to calculate ***real GDP***. The GDP deflator is a broader measure of inflation than the Consumer Price Index (CPI), as it includes all items that make up domestic production, not just consumer goods (which can also include foreign-produced goods in the CPI basket). To calculate the GDP deflator, the formula is as follows: 
$$\frac{Nominal \space GDP}{Real \space GDP} \times 100$$
# Nominal Income
==Definition==: refers to today's income measured in today's dollars. These dollars are unadjusted for inflation. If your nominal income rises, but the price level also rises, your real income (purchasing power) might not increase as much, or could even fall.
# Aggregate Income
==Definition==: The sum of all income earned by suppliers of resources in the economy. According to the basic circular flow model, if all spending is added up, it equals all income, and either measure provides GDP. The income approach to GDP counts income derived from production, including wages, rental income, interest, income, and profit. 
# Real Income
==Definition==: Is today's income measured in base year dollars. These are inflation-adjusted dollars that can be compared from year to year to determine whether purchasing power has increased or decreased. To calculate real income, you deflate nominal income by the CPI (or price index). The Formula is as follows: 
$$Real \space Income = \frac{(Nominal \space Income)}{CPI(hundredths)}$$
In terms percentage change:
$$ \% \Delta Real \space Income = \% \Delta Nominal \space Income - \% \Delta Price \space Income$$
# Expected Inflation
==Definition==: Refers to the inflation anticipated in a future time period. This expected inflation is added to the real interest rate to compensate for lost purchasing power. As long as actual inflation matches expected inflation, individuals like workers, employers, savers, lenders, and borrowers are not harmed by inflation. However when price levels are unpredictable or increase by an amount different from what was predicted, it becomes unexpected inflation, which causes some sectors of the economy to gain and others to lose. 
# Real Rate of Interest
==Definition==: The real rate of interest is the cost of borrowing to fund an investment. It is the percentage increase in purchasing power that a borrower pays a lender. It can be thought of as the marginal cost of an investment project. The real interest rate is equal to the nominal interest rate minus the expected rate of inflation. This is the interest rate used for long term decisions like investment and saving because it accounts for expected inflation. In the market for loan-able funds, the real interest rate is typically depicted on the vertical axis.
# Unemployment (4 Types)
==Definition==: Unemployment occurs when an economy has idle resources, most commonly applied to labor, leading to operation inside the production possibility frontier. To be counted as unemployed, a person must be 16 years or older, not currently working, but actively searching for work. The unemployment rate (UR) is the ratio of unemployed (U) to the total labor force (LF), calculated as: 
$$UR=\frac{U}{LF}\times100$$
**There are four types of unemployment**:
1. *Frictional Unemployment*: This occurs when someone new enters the labor market or switches jobs. It can be voluntary (seeking a better job match, just finished schooling) or caused by being fired for poor work habits. It is usually short lived and considered the least troublesome. 
2. *Seasonal Unemployment*: This type results from periodic and predictable job loss that follows the calendar. Examples include agricultural jobs, summer jobs, or winter ski lodge employment. Workers and employers anticipate these changes, so the damage is minimal. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) accounts for this, so it does not affect the published unemployment rate. 
3. *Structural Unemployment*: This is caused by fundamental, underlying changes in the economy that lead to job loss for skills no longer in demand. Examples include automation replacing manual labor or a product becoming obsolete. It is serious and long term, requiring workings to adapt their skills. Changes in minimum wages and labor unions can also contribute to structural unemployment by creating higher wages that leave some people wanting to work without a job. 
4. *Cyclical Unemployment*: This type of unemployment rises and falls with the business cycle. It increases during economic contraction (recessions) and falls during expansions. It is typically felt throughout the economy, making it the focus of macroeconomic policy. Structural unemployment might be permanent, but cyclical unemployment lasts only as long as the recession. 
# Labor Force Participation Rate
==Definition:== The percent of people in the country who are eligible and able to work. Calculated as: $$LFPR = \frac{LF}{Population}\times 100$$
# Discouraged Worker
==Definition==: Workers who are citizens who have been without work for so long that they become tired of looking for work and drop out of the labor force. Because these individuals are no longer actively searching for work, they are not counted in the ranks of the unemployed. This omission results in the reported unemployment rate being understated, making the economy appear stronger than it actually is. The BLS also measures "marginally attached workers," who recently looked for work and would prefer a job but aren't currently looking, and includes them in a broader measure of unemployment called "U6".
# Natural Rate of Unemployment
==Definition==: The natural rate of unemployment is the unemployment rate associated with full employment. It exists when there is no cyclical unemployment in the economy. At this rate, frictional and structural unemployment are still present, as they are considered normal and sometimes beneficial in a rapidly evolving economy. In the United States, this rate has traditionally been estimated between 5-6 percent, though some economists have revised it to around 4 percent due to prolonged economic expansions. This is considered the long-run equilibrium of unemployment in a country. The actual unemployment rate can be expressed as: $$Actual \space Unemployment = Natural \space Unemployment + Cyclical \space unemployment$$
# Inflation Rate
$$Inflation \space Rate = \frac{CPI_1-CPI_2}{CPI_1}\times 100$$
