# Circular Flow (Graph)
==Definition==: Illustrates how money, goods, services, and resources move between households and businesses in the economy.
- Households own resources (land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship) and sell them in the factor market to businesses.
- Businesses (Firms) use these resources to produce goods/services and sell them in the product market. 
- Government and foreign sector can also be added, but the simple model is just households + firms

# GDP (Gross Domestic Product) & its Parts
==Definition==: The total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in one year
### Formula: 
$$GDP=C+I+G+(X-M)$$
- C = Consumption (Household Spending)
- I = Investment (Business Spending on capital goods)
- G = Government spending (excluding transfers)
- X-M = Net Exports (exports minus imports)
# Nominal GDP
==Definition==: GDP Measured in current prices (Not adjusted for inflation)
### Formula:
$$Nominal GDP=\sum{(P_t\times Q_t)}$$
*Where P equals price in year t and Q equals quantity in year t*
# Real GDP 
==Definition==: GDP Measured in constant/base year prices, adjusted for inflation
### Formula:
$$RealGDP = \sum{(P \tiny base \normalsize \times Q_t)}$$
# Base Year
==Definition==: The year chosen as a point of comparison for prices when calculating real GDP and price indices
- Real GDP uses base year prices
- CPI uses base year basket costs
# Price Index
==Definition==: A measure that shows how average prices change over time
### Formula:
$$Price \space Index = \frac{Cost\space of \space Market \space Basket \space in \space Current \space Year}{Cost \space of \space Market \space Basket \space in \space Base \space Year} \times 100$$
# Consumer Price Index
==Definition==: Measures changes in the average price of a fixed "market basket" of goods/services purchased by households. 
- Most widely used price index
### Formula:
$$CPI = \frac{Cost\space of \space Market \space Basket \space in \space Current \space Year}{Cost \space of \space Market \space Basket \space in \space Base \space Year} \times 100$$

# Market Basket 
==Definition==: A representative collection of goods and services that households typically buy.
- Used to calculate the CPI and Inflation
# Final Goods
==Definition==: Goods purchased by the end user and counted in GDP to avoid double-counting.
# Intermediate Goods
==Definition==: Goods not used in the production of final goods and not counted in GDP (Their value is already included in final goods).
# Non-market Transactions
==Definition==: Economic Activities not included in GDP because they are not sold in markets.
