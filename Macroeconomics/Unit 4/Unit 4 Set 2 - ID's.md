# The Present and Future Value of Money (along with the equation)
==Definition==: The concept of the time value of money means that dollars today are worth more than the same amount of money in the future. This principle is the most important reason for paying interest on savings and charging interest on borrowing. The Present Value (PV) is the amount of money needed today to produce a given amount of money at some future time assuming a certain interest rate (r). The Future Value (FV) is the value of current dollars at a point in the future. The interest rate is the key tool used to convert present and future dollars to the same time period. 
- *The relationship between present value and future value for a single period (t=1): 
$$FV=PV \times (1+r)$$
- *Conversely, the present value of money received a year from now can be calculated as: * $$PV = \frac{FV}{(1+r)}$$
- *If lending money for two years, the future value calculation is:* $$FV=PV(1+r)^2$$
# Velocity of Money
==Definition==: The velocity of money (V) is defined as the average number of times that a dollar is spent in a year. It represents the rate at which money changes hands or is exchanged from one transaction to another. This theory is central to the **Quantity Theory of Money**, which uses the **Equation of Exchange**: $$MV=PQ$$ where M is the money supply, V is velocity, P is the price level, and Q is real GDP (or volume of transactions, T). Velocity is calculated as: $$V=\frac{PQ}{M}$$
# M1 and M2 Money
==Definition==: The money supply is quantified by the Federal Reserve (Fed) and categorized based on asset liquidity, which measures how easily an asset can be converted to cash.
- **M1 Money**: M1 is the most liquid measure of the money supply. It serves as the basis for all other broader money definitions. M1 includes: Cash, coins, checking deposits, and traveler's checks.
- **M2 Money**: M2 is categorized as slightly less liquid than M1 and includes M1 plus several near-moneys. M2 includes: M1, Savings deposits, small time deposits (certificates of deposit (CD's) under $100k), money market deposits, and money market mutual funds. 
# Asset Demand and Transaction Demand for Money
==Definition==: The demand for money is the inverse relationship between the nominal interest rate and the total quantity of money demanded, which is comprised of two components: transaction demand and asset demand. 
- **Asset Demand for Money** is the amount of money demanded by individuals who choose to hold money as a financial asset (a store of value). The main advantage of holding money as an asset is that its value does not diminish due to fluctuations in markets like the stock market or real estate market. However, the main disadvantage is that holding cash does not earn interest. Asset Demand is inversely related to the nominal interest rate. As interest rates on bonds or savings accounts rise, the opportunity cost of holding cash increases, leading people to demand less money as an asset and instead seek higher-interest financial assets. 
- **Transaction Demand for Money** is the amount of money held in order to make transactions. Transaction demand is determined by nominal GDP. If nominal GDP increases (due to higher output or higher prices), consumers demand more money for buying goods and services. This demand is generally considered independent of the nominal interest rate, meaning that when plotted on a graph with nominal interest rate on the y-axis, it is a constant (vertical line).
# Fractional Reserve Banking
==Definition==: A system in which commercial banks hold only a fraction of the total money deposited in them as currency in reserve. The remaining portion is loaned out to customers. This system, combined with the banks profit motive, is the foundation for money creation. The fraction of total deposits kept on reserve is known as the reserve ratio. 
# Balance Sheet (T-Account)
==Definition==: A tabular method used to show the assets and liabilities of a bank. The fundamental rule is that total assets must equal total liabilities. T-accounts are specifically utilized to demonstrate how new deposits are converted into loans and result in the creation of new money within the banking system. 
# Reserve Requirement and Reserve Ration
==Definition==: 
- **Reserve Ratio** is the fraction (or percentage) of a bank's total deposits that must be held in reserve. It is calculated as the ratio of required reserve to total deposits. This ratio is typically 10%
- **Reserve Requirement (or Required Reserves)** is the portion of a deposit that must be held at the bank for potential withdrawals. Mathematically, required reserves are equal to the reserve ratio multiplied by total deposits. 
# Excess Reserves
==Definition==: The portion of a bank deposit that is not legally required to be held as reserves. These funds are available to be loaned out by the bank to customers. Excess reserves are calculated by subtracting required reserves from the total reserves. In the fractional reserve system, this lending of excess reserves is what initiates the money creation process.  
# Liability vs. Assets of a Banks
==Definition==: An asset is anything owned by the bank or anything that is owned to the bank. 
# Open Market Operations
==Definition==: *Open Market Operations* are the monetary policy tools most frequently used by the Federal Reserve. They involve the Federal Open Market Committee buying or selling Treasury bonds (Securities) on the open market from or to commercial banks and the public. 
- **Buying Securities (Expansionary OMO)**: When the Fed buys securities, banks receive excess cash reserves, which begins the money creation process. This leads to an expansion of the money supply and a decrease in the nominal interest rate. 
- **Selling Securities (Contractionary OMO):** When the Fed sells securities, banks must pay for them, decreasing their excess cash reserves. This halts the money creation process (or begins money destruction), leading to a contraction of the money supply and an increase in the nominal interest rate. 
# Federal Funds Rate vs. Discount Rate
==Definition==: Both the Federal Funds Rate and the Discount Rate are both interbank interest rates, but they refer to transactions with different lending entities.
- **Discount Rate** is the interest rate that the Federal Reserve charges commercial banks for short term loans. Lowering the discount rate makes it cheaper for banks to borrow from the Fed, increasing banks' excess reserves and thus expanding the money supply. Raising the rate discourages borrowing, decreasing excess reserves and contracting the money supply. The Fed generally changes the discount rate in lockstep with the target federal funds rate. 
		- **Federal Funds Rate** is the interest rate that banks charge other banks for short-term (often overnight) loans. The FOMC sets a target for the federal funds rate and then uses OMOs (or other tools in modern policy environments) to influence the money supply and hit that target.
