# Money as an Asset
==Definition==: Refers to money held as a store of value. It is held at very little risk, unlike investments in the stock market. However, the main disadvantage of holding money as an asset (such as cash) is that it does not earn interest. The amount of money demanded as an asset varies inversely with the interest rate; as interest rates rise, people are more likely to invest in bonds or savings accounts, thus demanding less money as an asset. 
# The Money Multiplier 
==Definition==: Measures the maximum amount of new checking deposits that can be created by a single dollar of excess reserves within the fractional reserve banking system. $$\frac{1}{rr}$$
Where "rr" represents reserve ratio. The concept and mathematics of the money multiplier are similar to those of the spending multiplier. The money multiplier effect works in reverse to cause money destruction if a withdrawal is made instead of a deposit. 
# Monetary Policy (Expansionary and Contractionary)
==Definition==: Refers to the actions taken by the Federal Reserve (Fed), the central bank, to influence the macroeconomy, often to stabilize prices and move the economy toward full employment. 

**Expansionary Monetary Policy (EMP)**: Designed to fix a recession by increasing Aggregate Demand (AD) and lowering unemployment. The Fed increases the money supply which lowers the interest rate, stimulating private consumption and investment, shifting AD to the right.

**Contractionary Monetary Policy (CMP)**: Designed to avoid inflation. The Fed decreases the money supply, which raises the interest rate, decreasing private consumption and investment, shifting AD to the left, and lowering the price level.
# Money Supply
==Definition==: The money supply is the fixed quantity of money in circulation at a given point in time as measured by the Federal Reserve. It is measured in terms of liquidity:
- M1 (Most Liquid): Includes cash, coins, checking deposits, and traveler's checks.
- M2 (Less liquid or near-moneys): Includes M1 plus savings deposits, small time deposits (CDs under $100k) money market deposits, and money market mutual funds
- M3 (Least Liquid): Includes M2 plus large time deposits (Over $100k). Because the money supply is constant at any given time, its curve is vertical when plotted against the nominal interest rate.
# Money Demand
==Definition==: The relationship between the quantity of money demanded and the nominal interest rate. It is the sum of two components:
- **Transaction Demand**: The amount of money held to make transactions, which is determined by nominal GDP or the price level, and is independent of interest rate
- **Asset Demand**: The amount of money held as a store of value, which is inversely related to the interest rate.
# Ample Reserves vs Limited Reserves 
==Definition==: This distinction describes two periods/approaches to monetary policy effectiveness: 
- **Limited Reserves (Traditional Policy)**: This is the range where open market operations (OMOs) have a large effect on the money supply and interest rates. Under this traditional view, the fractional reserve banking system ensures that when the Fed changes banks' reserves, they lend excess reserves to earn a profit, leading to money creation or destruction, thus affecting interest rates.
- **Ample Reserves (Modern Policy)**: This approach emerged after the 2008 recession when central banks flooded commercial banks with sufficient reserves. When reserves are already ample, further changes in the money supply (MS) would have no effect on interest rates. In this environment, the Fed focuses on targeting the federal funds rate by manipulating specific interest rates like the Interest on Reserves (IOR), rather than relying solely on traditional OMOs. 
# Stocks
==Definition==: A stock is a certificate that represents a claim to, or share of, the ownership of a firm. When a company wishes to expand, it may raise money by issuing and selling these partial shares of ownership. 
# Bonds
==Definition==: A bond is a certificate of indebtedness from the issuer (the firm or the government) to the bondholder. Bonds are used when a firm wants to raise money by borrowing. They promise the bondholders the principal amount, plus a specified interest rate, with repayment due on a specific maturity date.
# Equity Financing
==Definition==: A firm's method of raising funds for investment by issuing shares of stock to the public, which avoids debt but requires relinquishing a small degree of control or profits. 
# Debt Financing
==Definition==: is a firm's method of raising investment funds by issuing bonds to the public committing that corporation to interest payments
# Fiat Money 
==Definition==: is today's paper and coin money that has no intrinsic value (unlike gold). It serves as money because the government declares it to be legal tender, and citizens accept it because they trust the government to keep its value stable.
# Money as a medium of Exchange
==Definition==: Money serves as a medium of exchange when it is used to facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers. It must be accepted by all parties as payment for goods and services. Money eliminates the need for the inconvenient barter system. 
# Money as a unit of Account
==Definition==: Money serves as a unit of account by using currency (dollars, yen, etc.) to measure the relative worth of goods and services. This provides a standard measure of value. 
# Money as a store of Value
==Definition==: Money serves as a store of value because it is a decent way to hold wealth over time, maintaining its value for weeks or months, provided prices are not increasing rapidly.
