# Consumption Function
==Definition==: A linear relationship that shows how increases in disposable income (DI) lead to increases in consumption. It is represented as:
$$DI=Gross \space Income- Net \space Taxes$$
- DI represents Disposable Income
# Savings Function
==Definition==: The savings function is a linear relationship showing how increases in disposable income (DI) cause increases in saving. It is also known as the savings schedule and shows the positive relationship between disposable income and saving. 
	The slope of the savings function is defined as the Marginal propensity to save (MPS). As disposable income (DI) increases for a typical household, both consumption (C) and savings (S)
The Savings Function is also represented by: 
$$DI = Gross \space Income \space - \space Net \space Taxes$$
# Autonomous Consumption
==Definition==: The amount of consumption that occurs no matter the level of disposable income (DI). It represents the consumption that households maintain even if their disposable income is zero. 
- In a linear consumption function, autonomous consumption appears as the constant term. 
- Graphically, it is the y-intercept of the consumption function. 
- This amount is assumed to be constant and unchanging with respect to changes in disposable income. 
# Autonomous Savings
==Definition==: The amount of saving that occurs no matter the level of disposable income (DI).
- In a linear saving function, autonomous saving shows up as a constant and graphically appears as the y-intercept
- If a household has zero disposable income, the negative value of autonomous saving indicates the amount the household would need to borrow (or dissave) in order to cover autonomous consumption
# Dissavings
==Definition==: An alternative way of stating that saving is less than zero. 
- Dissaving occurs at low levels of disposable income when consumers must liquidate assets (sell wealth) or borrow to maintain their consumption level. 
# Investment
==Definition==: Current spending in order to increase output or productivity later. It is one of the four components of aggregate spending (GDP).
- The decision to invest is based on comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs. The investment is made if the expected real rate of return "*r*", is greater than or equal to the real rate of return "*i*" (The cost of borrowing).
- Investment spending included in the GDP falls into three general types: 
	- New capital machinery purchased by firms. 
	- New construction for firms or consumers (including residential housing)
	- Market value of the change in unsold inventories. 
- In the market for loanable funds, investment represents the demand for funds. 
# Investment Demand
==Definition==: The inverse relationship between the real interest rate and the cumulative dollars invested. 
- It is drawn with a negative slope. As the real interest rate falls, borrowing becomes less costly, making more projects profitable and increasing the total amount of investment. 
- The investment demand curve can also be viewed as the demand for loanable funds. 
# Autonomous Investment
==Definition==: The level of investment determined by investment demand. 
- It is defined as autonomous because it is assumed to be constant at all levels of GDP. While interest rates or other investment demand factors can cause autonomous investment to shift upward or downward, at that new level, it remains constant with respect to GDP.
# Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)
==Definition==: Defined as the change in consumption caused by a change in disposable income (DI). Represented as: 
$$MPC = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta DI}= slope \space of \space consumption \space function$$
- Represents the increase in consumer spending when disposable income rises by 1
- The MPC will always be a value between 0 and 1 because some portion of new income will always be saved. 
# Marginal Propensity to Save
==Definition==: The change in saving caused by a change in disposable income. It is also defined as the slope of the saving function. Represented by: 
$$MPS=\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta DI}$$
- *The Sum of the MPC and MPS is always equal 1*
# Determinants of Consumption and Savings
==Definition==: While disposable income (DI) is the most important factor affecting consumption and savings several external determinants cause the entire consumption and saving functions to shift upward or downward.

However, as debt accumulates, more DI is used to pay off the debt, resulting in a decrease in both consumption and saving functions.                                                                                                              |
| *Taxes and Transfers* | Shifts upward (if taxes down or transfers up) Shifts downward (if taxes up or transfers down) | Shifts the same direction as consumption               | Unlike other determinants, changes in taxes and transfers shift both functions in the same direction. Increased taxes decrease both consumption and saving because more gross income goes to the government. Increases in government transfer payments (like Social Security) cause both C and S to increase. |
| *Real Interest Rates* | Increase (if rates go down) or decreases (if rates go up)                                     | Decreases if rates go down or Increases if rates go up | Lower real interest rates can cause consumption to increase and saving to decrease. higher real interest rates increase saving but decrease consumption.                                                                                                                                                      |

# Spending Multiplier
==Definition==: The multiplier effect is the process describing how a change in any component of autonomous spending creates a larger change in GDP. Components of autonomous spending include consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. The process works in successive rounds of spending: when initial spending (like investment) enters the economy, it becomes income for resource suppliers. These recipients then spend a fraction of that new income (equal to the MPC) and save the remainder (MPS). This newly spent amount becomes income for others, perpetuating the cycle until the increase in GDP stops. The spending multiplier measures the magnitude of this effect. It is calculated using the marginal propensities to consume (MPC) or save (MPS). 
**Representations:**
$$Multiplier=I/MPS$$
$$Multiplier=\frac{I}{I-MPC}$$
$$Multiplier = \frac{\Delta GDP}{\Delta Spending}$$

# Tax Multiplier
==Definition==: Measures the magnitude of the effect that a change in taxes has on real GDP. When taxes are decreased, households receive an increase in disposable income (DI). They respond by increasing consumption by the MPC and saving by the MPS. The tax multiplier is smaller than the spending multiplier. This is because the spending multiplier works immediately when money is injected into the economy. In contrast, the tax multiplier must first pass through the household's consumption function as disposable income. In the first round of spending after a tax cut, some of the money leaks out as savings (a factor of MPS), meaning the multiplier effect begins on an amount less than the original tax change. 
**Representation:**
$$TM=MPC\times (Spending \space Multiplier)$$
$$TM=\frac{\Delta GDP}{\Delta taxes}$$
$$TM =MPC*M=\frac{MPC}{MPS}$$

# Balanced Budget Multiplier
==Definition==: The balanced budget multiplier appliers when a change in government spending is offset by an equal change in taxes; meaning dollars collected equal dollars spent. The magnitude of the balanced budget multiplier is always equal to one. This means that if government spending increases by $00 and taxes increase by $100, real GDP changes only by the amount of change in spending, or +$100. This occurs because the initial positive spending effect (M) is partially cancelled out by the smaller negative tax effect. 

**Multiplier** = 1
