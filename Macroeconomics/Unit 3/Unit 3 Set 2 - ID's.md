# Real Rate of Return 
==Definition==: The marginal benefit a firm anticipates receiving on an investment expenditure. It is defined as the rate of real profit a firm anticipates receiving on investment expenditures. 
- If the percent return is greater than or equal to the investment, then make the investment
- If the percent return is less than the investment, do not make the investment. 
# Real Rate of Interest
==Definition==: The cost of borrowing. It is the percentage increase in purchasing power that a borrower pays a lender. 
# Loanable Funds
==Definition==: A crucial macroeconomic concept detailing the relationship between saving and investment. It is a hypothetical market for dollars that are available to be borrowed for investment projects. When households save money in banks or buy bonds, these funds become available to be borrowed by firms for private investment. The equilibrium in this market is determined at the real interest rate where dollars saved equals dollars invested.
# Demand and Supply for Loanable Funds (Graph)
==Definition==: The market for loan-able funds graph illustrates the determination of the equilibrium real interest rate:
- *Demand for Loanable Funds*: There is an inverse, or negative, relationship between investment and the real interest rate: as the real interest rate falls, borrowing is less costly, making investment projects more attractive to firms.
- *Supply for Loanable Funds*: This comes from saving. It originates from private saving (household DI greater than consumption) and public saving (government collecting more tax revenue than it spends, resulting in a surplus). Private saving is positively related to the real interest rate: as the rate rises, savings increases. If the government runs a deficit (negative public saving), the supply of loan-able funds falls.

# Aggregate Demand and Supply (Graph)
==Definition==: The most important model in macroeconomics, used to explain equilibrium national output and the general price level. 
- *Aggregate Demand (AD)*: this curve shows the inverse relationship between all spending on domestic output and the average price level of that output. It is downward sloping due to the Foreign Sector Substitution Effect, The Interest Rate Effect, and the Wealth Effect. 
- *Aggregate Supply (AS)*: This curve shows the positive relationship between the level of domestic output produced (Real GDP) and the average price level of that output. The shape of the AS curve depends on the time horizon (long run vs. short run)
- *Macroeconomic Equilibrium*: This occurs where AD intersects AS, determining the equilibrium real GDP and price level.

# Short-Run and Long-Run Aggregate Supply
==Definition==: In the macroeconomic short run, prices of goods and services are changing in their respective markets, but input prices have not yet adjusted to those changes. The Short Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) curve is often described in three stages. 
1. Stage 1 (Recessionary): When output is low (GDPu), there are many unemployed resources. Increasing output from this level puts little pressure on input costs, resulting in a minimal increase in the overall price level. The curve is drawn as almost horizontal (a concept associated with the Keynesian School of economics). Sticky wages exist during this phase - wages that react slowly to the rise and fall of the economy. 
2. Stage 2 (Approaching Full Employment): As real GDP increases toward full employment (GDPf), resources become harder to find, causing input costs, producers are incentivized to increase output. The SRAS curve typically shows a positive, upward slope in this range where the economy spends most of its time. 
3. Stage 3 (Capacity): If the economy appraoches its productive capacity (GDPc), firms cannot find unemployed inputs. Input costs and the price level rise much more sharply, making the curve almost vertical. 

The macroeconomic long run is a period long enough for input prices to have fully adjusted to market forces. In this period, all product and input markets are in equilibrium, and the economy is operating at full employment (GDPf). The LRAS curve is therefore vertical at GDPf. If the economy is is producing above or below full employment in the short run, it will adjust back to GDPf in the long run. Factors that shift the LRAS curve include permanent changes such as the availability of resources, technology, productivity (Human Capital), and policy incentives (like tax incentives to invest in capital).
# Components of AD (Aggregate Demand)
==Definition==: Aggregate demand is defined as the relationship between all spending on domestic output and the average price level of that output. It is a model of how domestic production changes when the average price level changes. 

The four general sources of demand in the macro-economy comprise of AD:
1. **Consumption Spending:** Spending by households. This is the largest component of GDP
2. **Investment Spending:** Spending by firms on items like new capital machinery, new construction for firms or consumers, and the market value of the change in unsold inventories. 
3. **Government Spending:** Government purchases of goods and services and investment in infrastructure. 
4. **Net Exports (X-M):** The final component, representing goods bought by foreign consumers (Exports) minus goods bought from foreign producers (Imports).
Mathematically, the sum of aggregate spending (GDP) is: 
$$GDP = C+I+G+(X-M)$$
An increase or decrease in any of these components, holding the price level constant, will cause a shift in the AD curve. 
# Macroeconomic Long Run Equilibrium
==Definition==: Occurs when the economy is operating at full employment. This state is achieved when *Aggregate Demand* equals *Long run aggregate Supply(LRAS)* 
- The macroeconomic long run is defined as a period of time long enough for input prices to have fully adjusted to market forces
- In this period, all product and input markets are in a state of equilibrium
- The *LRAS* curve is drawn vertically at the full employment level of GDP
- The Classical School of Economics asserts that the economy always gravitates toward full employment, making the vertical AS curve a cornerstone of their macroeconomics. 
- In the long run, regardless of the price level, the economy will produce at the full employment output. 

# Recessionary Gap (Graph)
==Definition==: A recessionary gap exists when the economy is in equilibrium but is operating below the full employment level of GDP. 
- It is measured as the amount by which full employment GDP exceeds equilibrium GDP
- When the economy is in a recessionary gap, it is likely experiencing a high unemployment rate
- **Graphical Representation:** The macroeconomic equilibrium (Intersection of AD and SRAS) is shown to the left of the vertical Long Run Aggregate Supply curve. The graph illustrates the difference between GDPf and the current real GDP as the recessionary gap.

# Inflationary Gap (Graph)
==Definition==: An inflationary gap exists when the economy is in equilibrium and is operating above the full employment level of GDP
- It is measured as the amount by which equilibrium GDP exceeds full-employment GDP
- Because production is higher than GDPf, the greatest danger to the economy is a rising price level (severe inflation)
- **Graphical Representation:** The macroeconomic equilibrium (intersection of AD and SRAS) is shown to the right of the vertical Long Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve. The graph illustrates the difference between the current real GDP and GDPf as the inflationary gap. 
- In the long run, labor shortages arise when the economy is operating above full employment, causing wages to rise. These higher input costs cause the SRAS to shift leftward until the economy returns to the full employment output.

# Demand-Pull Inflation
==Definition==: Demand Pull inflation is defined as inflation that results from stronger consumption from all sectors of Aggregate Demand (AD).
- This occurs as AD continues to increase (shifting to the right) in the upward sloping range of the Short Run Aggregate Supply (AS) curve
- When AD shifts rightward beyond full employment, inflation is quite significant, and real GDP experience experiences minimal increases. 
- If AD increases in the upward sloping range of SRAS, the price level begins to rise and inflation is felt in the economy. 
# Supply-Side Boom
==Definition==: A supply side boom is a macroeconomic situation in which the Aggregate Supply (AS) curve shifts outward (to the right) while Aggregate Demand (AD) remains constant. 
- The effects of a supply-side boom is a macroeconomic situation in which the Aggregate Supply (AS) curve shifts outward (to the right) while Aggregate Demand (AD) remains constant. 
- This is typically described as the best of all possible macroeconomic situations
- If AS increases because of a more permanent factor like increased productivity or better technology, the LRAS curve and the level of employment  could move outward. However, the immediate boom is usually described as temporary.
# Stagflation
==Definition==: Stagflation is a situation in the macro economy where inflation and the unemployment rate are both increasing. 
- It is also known as cost-push inflation.
- Stagflation is the result of a decrease, or leftward shift, in the Aggregate Supply (AS) curve while Aggregate Demand (AD) stays constant. 
- In the long run, the high unemployment associated with stagflation should eventually bring down the cost of input prices, causing the SRAS curve to shift back to the right and return the economy to full employment. 
# Supply Shock 
==Definition==: A supply shock is an economy-wide phenomenon that affects the costs of firms and consequently results in a shifting Aggregate Supply (AS) curve. 
- Supply Shocks can be positive (e.g. technological improvements or lower energy costs) or negative (e.g. unexpected higher resource prices or oil embargoes).
- *Negative Supply Shocks* (Like higher resource prices) shift the AS curve to the left.
- *Positive Supply Shocks* shift the AS curve to the right
- A supply shock also impacts the Phillips curve, shifting it inward (left) when AS shifts right  (inflation and unemployment both fall) and outward (right) when AS shifts left (stagflation)
# The Phillips Curve (Graph)
==Definition==: The Phillips curve is a graphical device that shows the relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate. 
- **Short Run Phillips Curve (SRPC)**: This curve is downward sloping, depicting the inverse relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate. If deflation occurs, the curve may continue falling below the x-axis. A shift in the Aggregate Supply (AS) curve causes the SRPC to shift in the opposite direction (e.g. AS shift left causes SRPC shift right - Stagflation)
- **Long-Run Phillips Curve**: This curve is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment is the unemployment rate where cyclical unemployment is zero. The vertical nature of the LRPC indicates that in the long run, unemployment always rests at the natural rate, regardless of the inflation rate. 
- Changes in Aggregate Demand (AD) result in a movement along the short-run Phillips curve.
