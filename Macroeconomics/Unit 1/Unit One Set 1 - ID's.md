# Scarcity
==Definition==: Implies limited quantities of resources to meet unlimited wants. Scarcity always exists because our needs and wants are always greater than our resources. 
==Example==: A farmer has 10 acres of land but wants to grow both wheat and corn. Only enough land exists for one crop
# Opportunity Cost
==Definition==: The Highest-value alternative that is given up when a decision is made.
==Example==: Choosing to study for 3 hours means giving up the opportunity to earn $30 from a part time job.
# Marginal Analysis (Marginal Benefit/Marginal Cost)
==Definition==: Comparing additional benefits vs. additional costs of a decision 
==Example==: A business weighs the cost of hiring one more worker ($100/day) against the extra revenue they generate ($150/day)
# Production Possibilities Curve
==Definition==: A graph showing all possible combinations of two goods an economy can produce given its resources.
==Example==: A country can produce 100 cars or 200 computers -- points on the curve show efficient production
# Functions of Economic Systems
==Definition==: Determine what to produce, how to produce, and for whom to produce. 
==Example==: A market economy uses prices to allocate resources (e.g. luxury cars for wealthy buyers)
# Law of Increasing Costs
==Definition==:  As production shifts from one good to another, opportunity costs increase
==Example==: Switching farmland from wheat to corn becomes harder (and more costly) as more corn is produced.
# Absolute Advantage
==Definition==: The ability to produce more of a good with the same resources
==Example==: country A produces 50 shoes, Country B produces 30 shoes -- Country A has an absolute advantage.
# Comparative Advantage
==Definition==: The ability to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than others 
==Example==: Country X gives up 2 hats to make 1 bike; Country Y gives up 4 hats -- Country X has a comparative advantage in bikes.
# Specialization
==Definition==: Focusing on production on goods with a comparative advantage.
==Example==: Saudi Arabia specializes in oil; the U.S. specializes in technology.
# Productive Efficiency
==Definition==: Producing at the lowest possible cost (any point on the PPC).
==Example==: A factory produces 1,000 units of a good using the fewest resources possible. 
# Allocative Efficiency
==Definition==: Producing a mix of goods most desired by society (MB = MC).
==Example==: A town builds a hospital instead of a mall because residents values healthcare more.
# Economic Growth
==Definition==:  An increase in an economy's production capacity (shifts PPC outward).
==Example==: New Technology allows a country to produce more goods than before.
# Market Economy
==Definition==: An economy where supply/demand determine prices and production.
==Example==: The U.S. economy, where business compete for consumer dollars.
# Law of Demand/Demand Curve (graph)
==Definition==: As price increases, quantity demanded decreases (downward sloping curve).
==Example==: If the price of pizza rises from $10 to $15, fewer people buy it.
