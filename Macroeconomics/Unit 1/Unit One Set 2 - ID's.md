# Determinants of Demand 
==Definition==: Factors that shift the *Demand Curve*. They include: 
- Tastes & Preferences
- Income (Normal vs. Inferior Goods)
- Prices of related goods (substitutes and complements)
- Expectations of future prices/income
- Number of buyers in the market
# Law of Supply/Supply Curve
==Definition==: the law of supply states that, ceteris paribus (all else equal), as the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied increases, and vice versa. The supply curve is an upward sloping graph showing this relationship. 
# Determinants of Supply 
==Definition==: Non-price factors that shift the supply curve:
- Input (resource) prices
- Technology 
- Number of sellers
- Expectations of future prices
- Government Actions (taxes, subsidies, regulations)
# Market Equilibrium
==Definition==: The point where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied at a certain price. Graphically, it is the intersection of the supply and demand curves. At this price, the market clears (no shortage or surplus).
# Disequilibrium
==Definition==: Any situation where demand does not equal supply at the current price. This results in either a surplus (excess supply) or a shortage (excess demand)
# All Else Equal (Ceteris Paribus)
==Definition==: Latin phrase meaning "holding all other factors constant." In economics, it isolates the effect of one variable (like price) by assuming nothing else changes.
# Substitution Effect
==Definition==: When the price of a good falls, consumers substitute it for more expensive alternatives, increasing its quantity demanded. Conversely, if the price rises, people switch to cheaper substitutes
# Income Effect 
==Definition==: A change in consumption that results when a change in price alters consumers' real purchasing power. For example, if prices fall, people feel "richer" and can buy more. 
# Normal Goods 
==Definition==: Goods for which demand increases when income rises, and decreases when income falls
# Inferior Goods 
==Definition==: Goods for which demand decreases when income rises, because consumer switch to higher-quality substitutes. 
# Substitute Goods
==Definition==: Two goods that can replace each other. If the price of one rises, demand for the other increases (e.g. Coke & Pepsi)
# Complimentary Goods
==Definition==: Goods that are consumed together. If the price of one rises, demand for the other falls. (e.g. PlayStation 5 price increases, demand for PlayStation games decreases)
# Shortage 
==Definition==: Occurs when the price is set below equilibrium, so quantity demanded > quantity supplied. Graphically, it is the gap between demand and supply below equilibrium. 
# Surplus
==Definition==: Occurs when the price is set above equilibrium, so quantity supplied > quantity demanded. Graphically, it's the gap between supply and demand above equilibrium.
